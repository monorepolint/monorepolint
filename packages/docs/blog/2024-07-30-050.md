I'm really excited to announce the release of v0.5.0.

This has been nearly 4 years of using MRL directly from main and its high time we make a release so its easy for everyone to use.

If you've used earlier version of MRL, you'll now see:

- Improved performance
- A new syntax format that gives you intellisense since its just js/ts
- New rules
- And more

Please forgive my lack of proper release notes here. Going forward we are using changesets to manage and track changes.
